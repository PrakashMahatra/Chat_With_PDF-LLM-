The application is designed to provide intelligent, context-aware responses based on user input.

## Features

- **Llama 3 Integration**: Utilized for generating high-quality text responses.
- **FAISS Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves embeddings for efficient similarity search.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.
- **Customizable Embeddings**: Enables storage and retrieval of domain-specific embeddings.
